# Spatial and Temporal Mutual Promotion for Video-based Person Re-identification


The code of a Refining Recurrent Unit (RRU) has been uploaded.

We are integrating our code with [deep-reid](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid).
The new code library will includes image-based re-id and video-based re-id. The optical flow and web page visualization are also supported. It will be released in [person-reid-lib](https://github.com/yolomax/person-reid-lib).


### Tips for the implementation of our methods in Spatial and Temporal Mutual Promotion for Video-based Person Re-identification

* Enough GPU: We use 4 1080ti.
* Enough trainign epoches: you can see the differences by testing from 100 epoches to 900 epoches for iLIDS and PRID-2011.
